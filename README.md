Google's Tsunami
  </h1>
<p>
  Google's Tsunami is a patch made to Chromebooks to stop downgrading
  and un-enrollment. Google has made a patch like this before called
  <a href="https://fog.gay">The Fog</a>. It was bypassed by <a href="https://mercurywork.shop">Mercury Workshop</a> and their team. They
  made a program called E-Halcyon. The Tsunami is another patch implemented 
  by Google to stop un-enrollment. This patch enabled hardware WP (write protection)
  and disabled WP by default. People have found a bypass but it is
  very difficult to use. Here I will explain step-by-step on how
  to un-enroll your chromebook past ChromeOS version 112.
