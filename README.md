Google's Tsunami
  </h1>
<p>
  Google's Tsunami is a patch made to Chromebooks to stop downgrading
  and un-enrollment. Google has made a patch like this before called
  <a href="https://fog.gay">The Fog</a>. It was bypassed by <a href="https://mercurywork.shop">Mercury Workshop</a> and their team. They
  made a program called E-Halcyon. The Tsunami is another patch implemented 
  by Google to stop un-enrollment. This patch enabled hardware WP (write protection)
  and disabled writing any code at all to disk by default.
  People have found a bypass but it is very difficult to 
  use. Here I will explain step-by-step on how to un-enroll 
  your chromebook past ChromeOS version 112.

> Before doing this step, please turn your chromebook off. If you do not turn off your chromebook, it will

    Now, lets start by taking apart your chromebook. You will
    need to take off the back cover revealing the motherboard. Once you have taken
    off the back cover, make sure to unplug the battery. There will be images listed along
    the way to help you visualize what you are doing.
